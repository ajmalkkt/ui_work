# ui_work
Here I am collating some of coding sample used for building some react js stuff with backend Spring boot. I m not adding any backend serivce here.. thats upto you if you want to have your own code to tweak the UI with new data. Please take a look and assess and send me any suggestions and questions you have.......... Please bear with any typo..
Node modules are deleted to reduce the size.. just reinstall if you want to set up the project locally.
Note:When you npm install them, they are downloaded from the web and copied into the node_modules folder and Node.js is trained to look for them there.

1- Auto refresh page - Simple order listing page with auto refresh feature to update the order placed every 1 min

2- some code added for trying out printing function from the UI
